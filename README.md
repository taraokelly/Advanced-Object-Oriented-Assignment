# Advanced Object Oriented Assignment
A Java web application, designed with object oriented principles and patterns in mind, that enables two or more text documents to be compared for similarity.

## Initial Plan

- [x] Message facade to hold requests and responses.
- [x] Consumer thread launches message facade requests from a thread pool.
- [x] Requests (to add & set up) - chain of responsibility or **command**.
- [ ] Proxy db handler.

## Additional OO Features

- Database Singleton - as we don't want threads to have different instances of the db. Then concurrent access would not be controlled.
- JaccardHashes Singleton - as we don't want the hashes to be able to change, corrupting the integrity of the minhashed shingles being add to the database and used for the jaccard comparison.

## Issues

### Deploying to Tomcat:

I had been working with eclipse while developing the non-servlet classes. When I deployed them to tomcat I had trouble creating the database. I then began using a Dynamic Web Application in Eclipse to get it working, however this Dynamic Web Application required the external jars to be in the application library. Once I had the database working in Eclipse, I transferred the classes back over to the original project. 

I then ran into another issue with accessing the resources package. This is important because I have two Requestable objects that are used in the command pattern - one to compare and one to populate the database. I have commented out and left the implementation in to demonstrate how the command pattern works and how a new object of type Requestable could be used in the command object.

I was also reading the random permutations from a text file in the resources directory. The permutations are now being read from the web.xml.

### Execeuter Shutdown

The addShutdownHook method was not working in tomcat as it had been working in eclipse. I had been using addShutdownHook to add a thread to call executer.shutdown() on program termination. To combat this I created a volatile shared variable with the Runnable Consumer class and it's caller, ServiceHandler. I add a destroy() method in the servlet that will automatically be called when terminating the servlet.

## How to Run

- Copy either the jaccard file or the jaccard.war into your Tomcat/webapps folder. **N.B. - only one!**.
- Create a directory called **G00322214** in your user Documents directory.
- Make sure the db4o v8 jars are in your Tomcat/lib folder.
- Start up tomcat with the startup.bat in your Tomcat/bin folder.
